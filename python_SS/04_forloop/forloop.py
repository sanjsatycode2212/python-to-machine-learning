#           for loop is a one type of loops in python programing language
#           we use this range() with for loop, for save time and computing power.

# Question 1:- print number 1 to n       >>> here we add N with +1 beause python indexing start from 0  <<<
# N = int(input("enter your input>>> "))
# for i in range(1,N+1): 
#     print(i)

# You can iterate through a string in two ways:- 

#         A  >   using index value
#         B  >   Iterating directly over the string


# A = "satyam"
# for i in range(len(A)): # first is we want to take a lenght using lenghth function is gives indexing values of "satyam".|||
#     print(A[i])

# output :- s
#           a
#           t            >>>>  it prints is character seprate seprate of variable A   <<<<
#           y
#           a
#           m

# second method :- 

A = "satyam"
for char in A:        #      >>>>           char is a predifined key which is store A and print seprate of each character 
    print(char)


# output :- s
#           a
#           t            >>>>  it prints is character seprate seprate of variable A using char key  <<<<
#           y
#           a
#           m
